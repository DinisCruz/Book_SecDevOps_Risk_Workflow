One of the biggest challenges in Agile and DevOps environments is the adoption rate of new technologies. In order to be as agile as possible there is a tendency to adopt new technology whenever it appears to have an advantage. Common examples are cloud technology, analytic tools, continuous integration tools, container technology, web platforms and frameworks, and client-side frameworks.

To prevent the adoption of immature, insecure, or privacy violating components it is important to review desires and proposed solutions. The technology advisory board should take up this role. It should consist of people with security, privacy, and (some) legal knowledge. It is important to not make this a new 'Change advisory board' with monthly review sessions doing a complete business impact analysis. Rather it should be in the form of a guild that is able to identify the maturity of the technology and possible impact on the ecosystem when things go wrong. It can also guard for implementing multiple tools with the same purpose. In this way the total ecosystem can be as lean and secure as possible.
