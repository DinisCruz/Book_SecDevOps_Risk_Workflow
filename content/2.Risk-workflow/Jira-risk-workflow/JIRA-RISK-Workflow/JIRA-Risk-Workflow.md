## JIRA RISK Workflow

![](images/Screen Shot 2016-03-02 at 16.32.58.png)

The following are the key concepts of this workflow:

  * All tests should pass all the time
  * Tests that check or confirm vulnerabilities should also pass
  * Business owners must understand the risks of their decisions, and they must click on the ‘accept risk' button
 
This workflow is about empowerment and assigning responsibility; it is not about apportioning blame.

Although I use JIRA for these examples, these concepts also apply to any bug-tracking system.
