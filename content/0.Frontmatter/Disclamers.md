### Disclaimers

* **(unit) Test** -  For me a test is anything that can be executed with one of these Unit Test Frameworks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks
* **RISK** - Abuse the concept, found RISK to be best one for the wide range of issues covered by AppSec, while being understood by all players
* **100% Code Coverage** - not the summit, but base-camp (i.e. not the destination). And 100% code is not enough, we really need 500% or more Code Coverage)
* **AppSec** ~= Non Functional requirements - AppSec is about understanding and controlling app’s unintended behaviours
