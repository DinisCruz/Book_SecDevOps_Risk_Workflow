### Security Champions Don't Take it Personally

If you are a security champion, don't take it personally if teams aren't listening to you. Don't think that you are the problem, that you aren't good enough or that you are failing to communicate in some way.

In most cases, the problem isn't you. The problem is actually the system; the company isn't structured in a way that allows the security champion's questions to be prioritised and answered.

So, if you find that you are struggling to get traction from a team, the team isn't responding, or it fights you, then drop those requests (as long as the Risk as been accepted). If they treat you as a TAX, as somebody who is giving them work they don't want to do, then also drop it.

In the Risk ticket, explain that you tried to persuade the team to accept the risks of not doing security, and that they are now responsible for their security, because you cannot help them.

In such cases the problem lies not with the security champion, but with the company and the organisation, maybe even sometimes with the team itself. This is why it is important to have success stories you can point to and say, "Hey! It worked with that team, and it worked with that team. If it doesn't work with this team, then I am not the problem".
