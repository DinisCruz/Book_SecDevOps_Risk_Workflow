### Defensible findings

A big lesson I have learned from my consulting work is that every time you present evidence of a security issue or a vulnerability, you must have highly defensible findings.

So, I always use the same thinking: I must present data and information that are completely accurate and truthful.  

This is very important, because if you present a report, especially if you present in an adversarial situation, where you have a team on the other side that doesn't want to hear your findings, or will dispute every single line of them, everything must be true.

It doesn't matter whether you are talking to the developer, the business owner, or the board; everything you do, and everything you say must be evidence-based.

And you can produce great evidence, but if finding number 17 contains exaggerations, or is less than watertight, that is exactly what your audience will focus on. And your credibility (and your hard work) will go down the drain.

Therefore, you must make sure that your approach is both pragmatic and objective. Without objectivity, you will lose your credibility. You must be certain that the statements that you have make sense from a business point of view. You can't say the house is on fire if it isn't on fire. You can't say this is a highly critical vulnerability, when at the end of the day a compromise won't bring the business down or cause too many problems.

In security, you do have vulnerabilities, data compromises, data confidentiality or integrity issues that will bring the business down, so you must put the problem you describe into perspective. 

One of the things I find very interesting is that from my position in security and risk analysis I can express strong opinions about architectural and design issues. I give those opinions from my point of view: "Here are the side effects, here are a couple of threat models on features, look at the difference between A and B. You can go with that architecture, fine, but here are the side effects. If you go with this different architecture it is much simpler, there are fewer things to do, and less difficult situations to deal with". 

I have learned that everything you do must be supported by evidence, so you can prove your point and defend your findings. Ensure everything is hyperlinked, because when you hyperlink you build a body of evidence. 

Having a thorough list of issues, and a documented set of risks when you get into 500+, is a good idea. You start to build historical evidence that you can use to say "I worked on the same problem in the past, here are the patterns we should follow. Although I can't prove why X, Y, Z is a problem today, this A, B, C issue had similar characteristics and it eventually blew up. So if you are going to accept the risks, be aware that the last time this happened it didn't end well".

It is a passive-aggressive way to deal with a problem. You aren't saying "Don't do it!", but you are drawing their attention to the potential consequences of taking a particular course of action. They can choose to ignore your advice, but this is where you can elevate the issue, and make it a decision for the business owner.
